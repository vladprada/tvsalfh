        <p>Whole world was filled with madness <br>
            As the leaves on those trees turned red <br>
            I woke up that October morning, my hair was a mess <br>
            I saw the notification, the rain continued to shed</p>

        <p>I felt like I already know you <br>
            And it’s so sad that it wasn’t true <br>
            We were through ups and downs <br>
            During this couple of months</p>

        <p>And I’m happy we’re here <br>
            Where we supposed to be <br>
            Reaching for the stars in the sky <br>
            Making each other smile</p>

        <p>You are my champion, breakthrough of the year <br>
            The best man alive, that’s what I truly feel <br>
            It’s so hard to put everything that lies in my soul <br>
            To words.</p>

        <p>Long way ahead, road-trip through America <br>
            And the farm in suburbs of California <br>
            Those are the dreams we’ve created together <br>
            And we will make it real, no doubts, I promise</p>

        <p>And I hope one day I would make you feel proud <br>
            Of the person that I have become <br>
            You are like a gardener, and I’m your honeysuckle <br>
            That you’re growing with the water of love</p>

        <p>Shine bright like a diamond, my superstar <br>
            And I will shine near you <br>
            So together we make a constellation so far <br>
            It will guide us like those moons do</p>

        <p>The beacon on the lonely island <br>
            The waves are crashing down around it <br>
            But the thing is we protect each other <br>
            Till the end of times</p>

        <p>The winds are changing yet they meet again <br>
            On this giant Earth that even I can’t put in my hands <br>
            So the destiny works the same, I suppose <br>
            And that’s how we met, I believe that it works</p>

        <p>I wonder how it all has happened <br>
            Longing for new things in my life <br>
            Overnight it all has changed swiftly <br>
            Vest on my chest is still bulletproof, sigh <br>
            Enough to save me from bastards, but <br>
            Your bullets have found their way to my heart <br>
            Only you can use those cute patrons <br>
            U filled them with love and affection <br>
            Sun rises every day and you go on and raise the bar <br>
            Of how people should be treated and goals must be achieved <br>
            My man is the best and nobody can tell me otherwise there <br>
            Under the rainbow, the legend says, you can find the chest and feast <br>
            Can I confess that I’ve found my treasure? Yes, I do <br>
            Hope you understand that this treasure is you</p>

        <p>Have fun and be free <br>
            Spread love and success <br>
            Anything you want in this life <br>
            Is coming your way since that night</p>
